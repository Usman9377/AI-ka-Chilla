when you create new environment, remember to install ipykernel also so that you can use this environment in jupyter notebook
- to create new environment use following commands
```bash
    conda create -n data_gathering python=3.10 -y
    conda activate data_gathering
```
  - there are following libraries for data fetching
    - wbdata

    pip install wbdata
    pip install pandas
    pip install ipykernel
```
