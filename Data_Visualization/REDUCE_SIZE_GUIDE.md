# Guide to Reduce Notebook Size

## Problem
Your `data_visualization.ipynb` file is **1,181,175 bytes (1.15 MB)** and needs to be **under 500 KB**.

## Root Cause
The notebook contains large base64-encoded PNG images in the output cells. These images are taking up ~95% of the file size.

## Solutions (Choose One)

### Solution 1: Use the Python Script (Recommended)
I've created `reduce_notebook_size.py` in this folder. Run it:

```bash
cd e:\AI_Chilla\AI_CHILLA_2026\Repositories\ai_chilla\Data_Visualization
python reduce_notebook_size.py
```

This will automatically remove all embedded images while keeping text outputs.

### Solution 2: Use Jupyter Notebook
1. Open `data_visualization.ipynb` in Jupyter
2. Click: **Cell** → **All Output** → **Clear**
3. Save the notebook (Ctrl+S)
4. Re-run cells if you want text outputs back (images won't be saved)

### Solution 3: Use nbconvert Command Line
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --clear-output --inplace data_visualization.ipynb
```

### Solution 4: Manual JSON Editing
If you're comfortable with JSON:
1. Open `data_visualization.ipynb` in a text editor
2. Search for `"image/png":`
3. Delete all lines containing base64 image data
4. Save the file

### Solution 5: Use JupyterLab Extension
Install and use `jupyterlab-stripoutput`:
```bash
pip install jupyterlab-stripoutput
jupyter lab
```
Then right-click the notebook → Strip Output

## Expected Results
- **Before:** ~1,181 KB
- **After:** ~50-100 KB (well under 500 KB target)
- **Reduction:** ~90-95%

## What Gets Removed
- ✗ Embedded PNG images (base64 data)
- ✓ Code cells (preserved)
- ✓ Markdown cells (preserved)
- ✓ Text outputs (preserved)

## Note
The images were generated by matplotlib/seaborn/plotly. When you re-run the notebook, new images will be generated but won't be saved in the file unless you explicitly save outputs.

## Verification
After reducing size, check the file size:
```bash
dir data_visualization.ipynb
```

Or in Python:
```python
import os
size = os.path.getsize('data_visualization.ipynb')
print(f"Size: {size:,} bytes ({size/1024:.2f} KB)")
```
